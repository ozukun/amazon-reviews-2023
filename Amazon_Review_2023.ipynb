       "      <td>Unfortunately Amazon in their wisdom (cough, cough) decided to ship the snowsuit in a vinyl bag with holes in it!  There was no other bag to protect the snowsuit inside vinyl bag with all the holes.  This is what happened:  Arrived in hub locker. It was the very top locker. Opened it &amp; pulled the pkg out getting a very wet &amp; nasty surprise at the same time. My senses were assaulted. Smells like tea tree oil. Feels like conditioner or lotion.  I can’t understand how the delivery person a) didn’t smell that mess when they shoved the pkg in b) didn’t see the mess when they shoved it in - tho if they were short I guess that would explain it bc I’m 5’10” &amp; I didn’t see it until the pkg was in my hands. The locker was up high &amp; dark, but I could smell it the minute I walked into the hub locker room. I happen to be extremely allergic to tea tree oil.  It’s made from mellaleuca trees which grow all over southwest Florida where I was raised.  Tho native to Australia they were used to help drain the swamps of Florida generations ago bc they soak up so much water.  It has a very distinct smell &amp; unfortunately is frequently used as a “carrier oil” for other oils &amp; body lotions,  shampoos, conditioners, etc., so I have to be hyper-vigilant to avoid exposure.  Instead- Last night I got to suck down Benadryl &amp; pray my throat didn’t close while keeping my epi-pens handy.  The liquid went through the holes &amp; onto the snowsuit as you can clearly see in the pictures.  So I guess the suit is waterproof.  Looks true to size.  Elastic appears stretchy.  I’m super annoyed that this arrived in this condition &amp; could have easily been avoided by amazon properly wrapping it to avoid the elements whatever they may be.</td>\n",

Zero interior pockets so nowhere to put glasses, iPhone, etc other than the 2 exterior pockets which should be larger imo as they are the only pockets.  Seems to me like they used a too large needle with the thread in mine bc it’s like the air comes through every single hole the thread is in that they used for decoration/insulation to give it a quilted effect.  With cotton fabrics you wash it &amp; the material will shrink around the thread &amp; you don’t have the air coming through the too large holes made by the needle.  I usually stick with the non-quilted versions of non-cotton coats fit this reason.  It looks nice, but it does not keep me warm in northern Colorado where we dip into negative temps &amp; have crazy high winds.  I was not impressed with it. Got it in tye try before you buy program without realizing I would have to pay for bags to return the items I tried or that I would have to drop them off at ups. I’m disabled.  I don’t drive.  So fun to pay for taxis to return stuff when Amazon has a flipping hub at my apt complex.  Why can’t they make returns simpler?  Delivered to the hub &amp; I should be able to return it to the hub imo.  Really ticks me off I don’t get anything delivered to my door anymore since moving to an apt. As a disabled person it’s a massive pain in my tush.  Every step is agony &amp; the stuff weighs more than I am supposed to lift.  It’s a long walk when you’re in chronic pain.  Should have sent it back with the rest bc now I’ll have to pay for another $3 bag &amp; taxis, but I wanted to try it in colder weather since it matched the color of my boots.  My bad.  Useless in cold weather.  The other issue I noticed was I tried 3 Columbia jackets in the same size (xl) bc I like to wear fleece &amp; layers under my coats due to the temps here &amp; the difference in sizing was ridiculous.  This was a true xl while the other two were not.  Easily managed camisole, T-shirt, &amp; long sleeved, very thick, fleece shirt under it.  Just does not keep you warm on its own.  It’s a spring jacket imo not winter.  It has a fuzzy fur inside &amp; I have coke to prefer fleece lined jackets bc I have service dogs &amp; their fur is easier to get off flat fleece than fluffy fur.</td>\n",

Wore them in Colorado in 36 degree weather &amp; I can feel air coming into the toe bed so my toes were cold.  Maybe they didn’t waterproof mine all the way idk or not at all bc mine are not.  I wire regular athletic socks today, but will try them again with wool socks later.  Either way they are one of the most comfy boots I have ever worn. The cushioning is magnificent. I’m disabled &amp; have bad knees, hips, &amp; spine &amp; these were the most comfy shoes I’ve probably had in my life. I say that as an LL Bean, Land’s End, Merrel, Keen, &amp; Columbia long time wearer.  I got the baby blue color for around $40 with tax which is a great deal imo.  The only big issue is I purchased them for winter walks with my dogs so they won’t work for their intended purposes. My dilemma is whether to keep them for spring boots.  The light color means they will get dirty fast so idk.  I just know they are crazy comfy &amp; feel wonderful on my feet. I might try them with some fleece socks too &amp; probably just spray them with boot waterproofing.  They are like a canvas tennis shoe. The material they are made out of.  So super light which I love due to my disabilities, but I don’t think I’ll be wearing these in the back country walks bc of the color I picked. Which I picked solely based on the price. I’m cost effective not cheap lol.  I admit when I got them from the amazon locker they were so incredibly light that I expected garbage.  While these are very light they are also an excellent walking boot imo tho if you need them to be waterproofed good luck bc mine are not.  If you are sticking to plowed roads &amp; sidewalks &amp; avoid big drifts of snow &amp; wear a thick wool sock these will probably work very well if you’re looking for a comfy hiking boot.  Unfortunately I need something that can go off roads into the wilderness &amp; snow drifts bc that’s where my service dogs prefer to walk. Lol.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ll start by saying I love this robe!  I truly do. Luckily I’d read other reviews and although normally I would immediately wash every item of clothing I purchase I decided to check the sewing and seams first. That said the quality assurance person should be fired. As you can see in the photos 2 seams are already coming undone as they were not seen properly.  There is also what I call “bobbin vomit” in several places where gobs of thread are in and around the seams and in other places there are just loose threads.  Some of the seams do not match up either. If it wasn’t for the seams that are already coming undone it is something I would normally overlook as it was close enough.  The other issue is the size. I’m 5’ 10” tall and I ordered the large/extra large as I’d read some complaints about size and especially short sleeve length. Let me tell you these sleeves will hold monkey arms!  I rolled them up twice!  They never happens to me with a large or extra large robe which I always buy big just to get the longer sleeve length. The length of time is excellent too as it is down between my calves and my ankles. I love the color. I love the robe, but due to the sewing errors as is bound to happen in mass manufacturing I am sending it back. I wish they had the sizes separated by small, medium, large, and extra large not lumping them s/m and l/xl.  I haven’t decided if I’m going to try the robe in a size smaller or just try a different robe.  If this robe was free of sewing mistakes I would have just kept it for a taller friend of mine.  It is the perfect weight. It’s not too heavy and it’s not too light. It is soft. It is fluffy. The pockets are nice and the sayin trummis a nice touch I love the hood. It was the deciding factor in my choosing this robe in the first place.  I’ll be sad to see it go as it really is an excellent robe if it didn’t have the bad seams in 2 places and the Bobbin vomit thread issues.  It’s the kind of robe you will want to snuggle and cuddle into and with someone. Two people will easily fit in this one!  I’m just afraid that if I buy the s/m that the arms will not be long enough and the robe length will be shorter too. I also hate that most s/m robe belts hit me under my breasts instead of at my natural waist and the pockets are located under each breast instead of along my hips. This robe belt fits perfectly at my waist and the pockets sit perfectly at my hips with no awkward belting or pocket maneuvering involved.  I’m really going to miss this robe!  I suspect I will end up with another one shortly, but hopefully one without flaws.</td>\n",

There was no other bag to protect the snowsuit inside vinyl bag with all the holes.  This is what happened:  Arrived in hub locker. It was the very top locker. Opened it & pulled the pkg out getting a very wet & nasty surprise at the same time. My senses were assaulted. Smells like tea tree oil. Feels like conditioner or lotion.  I can’t understand how the delivery person a) didn’t smell that mess when they shoved the pkg in b) didn’t see the mess when they shoved it in - tho if they were short I guess that would explain it bc I’m 5’10” & I didn’t see it until the pkg was in my hands. The locker was up high & dark, but I could smell it the minute I walked into the hub locker room. I happen to be extremely allergic to tea tree oil.  It’s made from mellaleuca trees which grow all over southwest Florida where I was raised.  Tho native to Australia they were used to help drain the swamps of Florida generations ago bc they soak up so much water.  It has a very distinct smell & unfortunately is frequently used as a “carrier oil” for other oils & body lotions,  shampoos, conditioners, etc., so I have to be hyper-vigilant to avoid exposure.  Instead- Last night I got to suck down Benadryl & pray my throat didn’t close while keeping my epi-pens handy.  The liquid went through the holes & onto the snowsuit as you can clearly see in the pictures.  So I guess the suit is waterproof.  Looks true to size.  Elastic appears stretchy.  I’m super annoyed that this arrived in this condition & could have easily been avoided by amazon properly wrapping it to avoid the elements whatever they may be.   \n",

Zero interior pockets so nowhere to put glasses, iPhone, etc other than the 2 exterior pockets which should be larger imo as they are the only pockets.  Seems to me like they used a too large needle with the thread in mine bc it’s like the air comes through every single hole the thread is in that they used for decoration/insulation to give it a quilted effect.  With cotton fabrics you wash it & the material will shrink around the thread & you don’t have the air coming through the too large holes made by the needle.  I usually stick with the non-quilted versions of non-cotton coats fit this reason.  It looks nice, but it does not keep me warm in northern Colorado where we dip into negative temps & have crazy high winds.  I was not impressed with it. Got it in tye try before you buy program without realizing I would have to pay for bags to return the items I tried or that I would have to drop them off at ups. I’m disabled.  I don’t drive.  So fun to pay for taxis to return stuff when Amazon has a flipping hub at my apt complex.  Why can’t they make returns simpler?  Delivered to the hub & I should be able to return it to the hub imo.  Really ticks me off I don’t get anything delivered to my door anymore since moving to an apt. As a disabled person it’s a massive pain in my tush.  Every step is agony & the stuff weighs more than I am supposed to lift.  It’s a long walk when you’re in chronic pain.  Should have sent it back with the rest bc now I’ll have to pay for another $3 bag & taxis, but I wanted to try it in colder weather since it matched the color of my boots.  My bad.  Useless in cold weather.  The other issue I noticed was I tried 3 Columbia jackets in the same size (xl) bc I like to wear fleece & layers under my coats due to the temps here & the difference in sizing was ridiculous.  This was a true xl while the other two were not.  Easily managed camisole, T-shirt, & long sleeved, very thick, fleece shirt under it.  Just does not keep you warm on its own.  It’s a spring jacket imo not winter.  It has a fuzzy fur inside & I have coke to prefer fleece lined jackets bc I have service dogs & their fur is easier to get off flat fleece than fluffy fur.   \n",

Mine are not.  Wore them in Colorado in 36 degree weather & I can feel air coming into the toe bed so my toes were cold.  Maybe they didn’t waterproof mine all the way idk or not at all bc mine are not.  I wire regular athletic socks today, but will try them again with wool socks later.  Either way they are one of the most comfy boots I have ever worn. The cushioning is magnificent. I’m disabled & have bad knees, hips, & spine & these were the most comfy shoes I’ve probably had in my life. I say that as an LL Bean, Land’s End, Merrel, Keen, & Columbia long time wearer.  I got the baby blue color for around $40 with tax which is a great deal imo.  The only big issue is I purchased them for winter walks with my dogs so they won’t work for their intended purposes. My dilemma is whether to keep them for spring boots.  The light color means they will get dirty fast so idk.  I just know they are crazy comfy & feel wonderful on my feet. I might try them with some fleece socks too & probably just spray them with boot waterproofing.  They are like a canvas tennis shoe. The material they are made out of.  So super light which I love due to my disabilities, but I don’t think I’ll be wearing these in the back country walks bc of the color I picked. Which I picked solely based on the price. I’m cost effective not cheap lol.  I admit when I got them from the amazon locker they were so incredibly light that I expected garbage.  While these are very light they are also an excellent walking boot imo tho if you need them to be waterproofed good luck bc mine are not.  If you are sticking to plowed roads & sidewalks & avoid big drifts of snow & wear a thick wool sock these will probably work very well if you’re looking for a comfy hiking boot.  Unfortunately I need something that can go off roads into the wilderness & snow drifts bc that’s where my service dogs prefer to walk. Lol.   \n",
       "3       I’ll start by saying I love this robe!  I truly do. Luckily I’d read other reviews and although normally I would immediately wash every item of clothing I purchase I decided to check the sewing and seams first. That said the quality assurance person should be fired. As you can see in the photos 2 seams are already coming undone as they were not seen properly.  There is also what I call “bobbin vomit” in several places where gobs of thread are in and around the seams and in other places there are just loose threads.  Some of the seams do not match up either. If it wasn’t for the seams that are already coming undone it is something I would normally overlook as it was close enough.  The other issue is the size. I’m 5’ 10” tall and I ordered the large/extra large as I’d read some complaints about size and especially short sleeve length. Let me tell you these sleeves will hold monkey arms!  I rolled them up twice!  They never happens to me with a large or extra large robe which I always buy big just to get the longer sleeve length. The length of time is excellent too as it is down between my calves and my ankles. I love the color. I love the robe, but due to the sewing errors as is bound to happen in mass manufacturing I am sending it back. I wish they had the sizes separated by small, medium, large, and extra large not lumping them s/m and l/xl.  I haven’t decided if I’m going to try the robe in a size smaller or just try a different robe.  If this robe was free of sewing mistakes I would have just kept it for a taller friend of mine.  It is the perfect weight. It’s not too heavy and it’s not too light. It is soft. It is fluffy. The pockets are nice and the sayin trummis a nice touch I love the hood. It was the deciding factor in my choosing this robe in the first place.  I’ll be sad to see it go as it really is an excellent robe if it didn’t have the bad seams in 2 places and the Bobbin vomit thread issues.  It’s the kind of robe you will want to snuggle and cuddle into and with someone. Two people will easily fit in this one!  I’m just afraid that if I buy the s/m that the arms will not be long enough and the robe length will be shorter too. I also hate that most s/m robe belts hit me under my breasts instead of at my natural waist and the pockets are located under each breast instead of along my hips. This robe belt fits perfectly at my waist and the pockets sit perfectly at my hips with no awkward belting or pocket maneuvering involved.  I’m really going to miss this robe!  I suspect I will end up with another one shortly, but hopefully one without flaws.   \n",

I was freezing my butt off at 40 degrees! These are very thin, so to call them \"fleece-lined\" feels deceptive. Not a fan! I'd rather pay for a pair of Kerrits, which are truly warm! I ordered a medium but could have sized down to small.   \n",
